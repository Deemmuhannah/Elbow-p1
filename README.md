# U-Bracket 3D Model(Elbow part 1) – Onshape

This project contains a 3D model of a U-bracket created using Onshape. The model is designed with precision for mechanical applications, suitable for mounting components or joining structural elements.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Rounded Base**: The bottom of the U-bracket is smoothly curved for structural strength and clean design.
- **Side Holes**: Two circular holes on each upright arm for screw/bolt mounting.
- **Hexagonal Recesses**: The base has four recessed hexagon-shaped pockets designed for countersunk fasteners (possibly bolt heads or nuts).
- **Symmetrical Design**: Ensures easy mounting and alignment.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **CAD Software**: [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/)
- **Design Techniques**: Extrude, Fillet, Shell, Sketch, Boolean Subtraction (for hole and hex pocket creation)

## 📏 Units & Dimensions

All dimensions were designed using **millimeters (mm)**.
